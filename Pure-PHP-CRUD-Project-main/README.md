# Pure-PHP-CRUD-Project
This project showcases the use of vanilla PHP to create an API and manage CRUD operations. 

# Vanilla PHP CRUD API Project

This project is a demonstration of how to create a custom framework using vanilla PHP and implement a RESTful API to handle CRUD operations for a specific example. In this case, the example is a simple online shop application that allows users to create, read, update and delete shops from a database.

## Project Structure

The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and uses object-oriented programming principles. The main components of the project are:

- `index.php`: The entry point of the application. It handles the routing of requests to the appropriate controllers and views.
- `Config/database.ini`: The configuration file that contains the database credentials.
- `Controllers`: The folder that contains the controller classes that handle the business logic and interact with the models and views.
- `Models`: The folder that contains the model classes that represent the data entities and perform the database operations.
- `Views`: The folder that contains the view files that display the data to the users in HTML format.

## How to Run /// IMPORTANT ///

To run this project, you need to have PHP installed on your machine and a web server such as Apache or Nginx. You also need to have a MySQL database server and create a database named `magasins`

Import sql dump shops.sql
Add the files to a folder with the name "hemwuntkhadun"
Access the website using the link: localhost/hemwuntkhadun/
